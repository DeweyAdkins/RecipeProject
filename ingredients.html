                        <strong>Chicken:</strong> Chicken breasts are seasoned and pan seared in olive oil and butter until moist on the inside, with a golden crust on the outside. We keep the seasonings simple with just salt, pepper, and our homemade Italian seasoning blend, since so much additional flavor comes from the cream sauce.

                        <strong>Pasta:</strong> Pasta is cooked in salted water until al dente, which is the bed of this dish. A long, flat noodle like Fettuccine is perfect here, providing more surface area for the sauce to cling to. Linguini is another great choice, or penne which is able to catch the sauce in its ridges. Honestly though, any pasta works.

                        <strong>Alfredo Sauce:</strong> We used our favorite Alfredo Sauce recipe for this dish. Butter, heavy whipping cream, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, garlic, and seasonings come together in a matter of minutes for the most incredible white sauce that coats the cooked pasta. Heaven!
